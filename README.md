# JavaScript Quiz Project

## Task
The aim of this project is to create a quiz that will ask a series of questions and produce a result on completion of all the questions.

## Requirements
- A Single HTML page. The user should not move from the page when answering the questions or getting the results.
- A simple design that uses bootstrap elements to manage layout.
- A seperate css file should be used for styling the page.
- The quiz should consist of at least 5 multiple choice questions.
- The quiz should process the users responses and produce a result at the end.
- Questions not in use should be hidden.
- User response could be either by selecting a radio button or clicking a picture link but should not use popup boxes or text entry.
- The result should be hidden until the end.
- Initial information about the quix should be displayed when the user first opens the page. This should be hidden whilst the user answers questions and when the results are displayed.
- Function should be resued where possible.

## Summary of Tech Stack
This is one of the first single HTML pages that I have created using Javascript and the one that introduced me to some new concepts in Javascript. 
For the design and layout I have used CSS and Bootstrap. 

## Functionality
The functionality of this webpage fulfills all the requirements listed above. A future extension of this project will be generating random questions from database or extractiong questions from a remote API.
